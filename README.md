## Structure

Wisp LSDFi Smart Contracts consists of 6 sub-modules

-   `pool`: implementation of core logic for Staking Liquidity Token pool and vdAMM
-   `wispSUI`: wispSUI token represent share of Staking Liquidity Token pool
-   `lsdfi`: wrapper module for pool's functions
-   `errors`: errors code
-   `utils`: utility functions and consts
-   `math`: functions for calculation

## Objects/Structs

### veWISP

Witness for veWISP coins - WispLSDFi governance coin represents share in the LSTs pool.

### AdminCap

This object represents ownership of this package. The object is required to perform certain permission assignments.

### PoolRegistry

This is the main storage object to store coins in pool and configure parameters. Fields:

-   `balances`: store all coins' balances in pool
-   `supported_lsts`: list of supported Liquid Staking Tokens in wispSUI protocol
-   `available_balances`: mapping from TypeName to available balances of coins in pool, used to query balances without a type argument
-   `max_diff_weights`: maximum weight differrence for each LST for every action. Each action can not move basket weights over these values.
-   `risk_coefficients`: risk parameters for each LST, used to calculate weight of LST in the pool
-   `wispSUI_treasury`: treasury object for wispSUI, use to store circulating wispSUI.
-   `acceptable_result_time`: max threshold time for updated time of aggregator data. If aggregator's updated time is greater than this value, the actions won't be able to be executed
-   `slope`: dynamic fee curve parameter
-   `base_fee`: base fee for LSTs swapping
-   `redemption_fee`: fixed fee for LSTs redemption
-   `sui_split_bps`: percentage of Sui to split and add to wispSUI/SUI AMM pool in basis points
-   `fee_to`: protocol fee receiver address
-   `is_sui_smaller_than_wispSUI`: pre-calculated value for adding SUI into pool, to reduce gas fee

### WithdrawReceipt

The "Hot potato" object represents the withdrawal output; it has no traits, so it cannot be transferred or stored elsewhere. Since withdrawal actions return coins in all types of supported LSTs, the WispSwap team uses this object type as a way to handle the withdrawals of multiple types of coins dynamically.
We take advantage of Programmable Transactions to consume this WithdrawReceipt object to retrieve coins after receiving them and drop it when all coins have been withdrawn.
Field:

-   `withdraw_amounts`: Mapping of coins' typenames to the amount to withdraw

## Public Interface

### Deposit

**Module: `lsdfi`**

```rust
    public entry fun deposit<T>(
        pool_registry: &mut LSDFIPoolRegistry,
        aggregator: &Aggregator,
        lst: Coin<T>,
        clock: &Clock,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    )
```

Type parameters:

-   `T`: LST to deposit into the pool

Parameters:

-   `pool_registry`: mutable reference to the LSDFIPoolRegistry object
-   `aggregator`: reference to the Aggregator object in the WispLSDFIAggregator package
-   `lst`: LST coin of type T
-   `clock`: reference to the Clock object (address: `0x6``)

Use: Put `lst` into the pool and transfer back to the sender corresponding amount of wispSUI

```rust
    public fun deposit_non_entry<T>(
        pool_registry: &mut LSDFIPoolRegistry,
        aggregator: &Aggregator,
        lst: Coin<T>,
        clock: &Clock,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    ): Coin<WISPSUI>
```

Same as `deposit` but returns a Coin of wispSUI type for further actions instead of transferring it to the sender.

```rust
    public entry fun deposit_mul_coin<T>(
        pool_registry: &mut LSDFIPoolRegistry,
        aggregator: &Aggregator,
        lsts: vector<Coin<T>>,
        amount: u64,
        clock: &Clock,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    )
```

Same as `deposit` but uses multiple Coins; leftovers will be transferred back to the sender.

-   `lsts`: a vector of coins of type T
-   `amount`: the amount to add to the pool

        sui: Coin<SUI>,
        clock: &Clock,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    ): Coin<WISPSUI>
